//contains constructor, Letter
//Letter should be able to display a
    //underlying character of
    //a blank placeholder
//depending on whether or not the user has guessed the letter
//The constructor Letter should define:
    //a string value to store the underlying character for the letter
    //a boolean value that stores whether that letter has been guessed yet
    //a function that returns the underlying character if the letter has been guessed
        //or a placeholder(underscore) if the letter has not been guessed
    //a function that takes a character as an argument
        //and checks it agains the underlying character
        //updating the stored boolean value to true if it was guessed correctly
